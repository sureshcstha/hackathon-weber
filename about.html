        <p>
            The <strong>Focus Tracker app</strong> is designed to help users stay on task by tracking their focus during various activities, such as work or study sessions, driving, piloting an aircraft, or even during a test exam. Using advanced <strong>Computer Vision AI</strong> technology, the app monitors facial expressions and facial landmarks in real-time, detecting when the user is focused or distracted. It provides an easy-to-use interface to start and stop sessions, track focus vs. distraction times, and view session history. All data is stored locally in the browser's <strong>localStorage</strong>, giving users the flexibility to review, delete, or reset their sessions at any time.
          </p>

            Built on the <strong>face-api.js</strong> library, the app uses AI models such as <strong>TinyFaceDetector</strong> for face detection, <strong>faceLandmark68Net</strong> for tracking facial landmarks, and <strong>faceExpressionNet</strong> to identify emotional states, such as happiness or frustration. The app can also play an alert sound if the user has been distracted for too long, helping users maintain focus in critical situations. Whether it's during driving, flying, taking an exam, or for individuals with <strong>ADHD</strong>, the app provides <strong>real-time visualizations</strong> of focus progress and session statistics, ensuring users stay aware of their focus habits and make improvements when necessary.
